# Machine Learning Basics from Scratch

This repo will have all the code that I used to learn about neural networks and machine learning. Some implementations use no libraries and only basic mathematical operations and loops, while others use libraries to make calculations simpler.

## Gradient-Descent

This section is about how gradient descent is implemented/works. The code in UpdateWeightsandBiases file performs one step of the gradient descent algorithm. 
It calculates the gradients and the changes to be made to the weights and the bias.






## House Price Prediction

Neural networks are a key component of modern machine learning. In this section, we delve into the theory behind neural networks, including:

- Neurons and activation functions
- Feedforward and backpropagation
- Gradient descent
- Regularization techniques
- Hyperparameter tuning

## Implementation

In the implementation section, we provide a step-by-step guide to building neural networks from scratch using Python. The implementation covers:

- Building a neural network architecture
- Initializing weights and biases
- Forward propagation
- Calculating loss and implementing backpropagation
- Updating weights and biases using gradient descent
